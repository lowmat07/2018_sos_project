    <h1>proposal</h1>
    <p>For my Student Originated Software programming project, I propose to design and implement a new model of information display on the internet. I will create a template for an entry in an expressions thesaurus as the model.</p>
    <p>The idea for the template is to allow a user to add new sayings, add new classifications to existing sayings, add alternative grammar spins of existing sayings, etc. The challenge is to create a system of data storage and linking between miscellaneous elements in a way that primarily reuses rather than repeats stored information.</p>
    <p>I intend on making the model in 2 parts following the client-server model that is used by most websites. I will start on the client-side first to produce a demo of what it could look like for the user. I will next work on server side storage of reuired data, and then will produce a first client/server prototype.</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3>client side</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>create a working concept prototype</li>
    	<li>interactive functionality is more important than design as the ultimate goal is to have multiple interfaces for different of users</li>
    	<li>a JSON virtual database can be used to simulate database access</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>server side</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>find database system with capacity for large storage</li>
    	<li>choose a database structure that easily permits the fields and contents of storage</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>extras</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>integrate git storage for site</li>
    	<li>make demonstration site responsive</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>Level 0: Minimal prototype (front-end)<br>
    Level 1: First working client/server prototype<br>
    Level 2: Complete more features and fix any bugs<br>
    Level 3: perfect the design?</p>
    
    <!--
    <br><br><br>
    <p>we will attempt to make a new system of data organization, on http's client/server model.</p>
    <p>we are after a sample case of a system where a word, phrase, etc could be its own data structure with tags</p>
    <p>we are after a successful enancement of http information. this idea may not be feasible in the time permitted through ths SOS program but we will attempt to make as much progress towards this as we can.</p>
    <p>have a conceptual are in discovery of a way of structuring http data.</p>
    <p>to allow client-side users to be able add to or tailor the data</p>    
    <p>(using any interface, but we will come up with an example interface for your illustration)</p>
